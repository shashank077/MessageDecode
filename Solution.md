# MessageDecode
Use to Bring out a hidden message from a given set of images in a folder 
A folder consists of the images showing alphabets and symbols
They mean nothing by default
But if you tinker with thier order of presentation may be it is possible
As you can see the name of every image contains a few digits attached to them 
IF WE REMOVE THOSE DIGITS AND RENAME THE FILES A MESSAGE SHALL APPEAR BY THE IMAGES.
